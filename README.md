# super-mario-google-map

The code here requires a Google Cloud Platform API key and a Google Maps custom Map ID in order to work.

The places that need updating are:

* Add the API_KEY and MAP_ID in the `<script>` tag for the Maps API in the `index.html` file
* Add in the MAP_ID in the `script.js` file
